# Description 

The model is trained on the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the continuous prices values of data.

Model contains several parameters:

* Location : Locality of the Pune.
* BHK : Size in BHK.
* Bathroom : Number of Bathrooms.
* Balcony : Number of Balcony.
* Sqft : Area in square feets.
* Area Type: Type of Residence.
* Availability : Ready to Move or not.

This is a Pune House Price Prediction Project - [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/saipavansaketh/pune-house-data?select=Pune+house+data.csv). The objective of the project is to perform data visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning often required to getting the understanding of the data and its insights. This project aims apply various [Python](https://www.python.org/) tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning operation on it.
